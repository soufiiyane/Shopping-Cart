# Shopping-Cart
the project is a clone of a shopping cart template i found on dribbble, so i tried to rebuild it and give it some functionality using Typescript.
please to start the project use LiveServer, since i'm using Xmlhttprequest to load the data from json file, 
and run the command (tsc script.ts --watch) in the terminal to watch for the tsc file.
